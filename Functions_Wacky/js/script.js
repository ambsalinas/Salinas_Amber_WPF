// A well-trained athlete could have a resting heart rate of 40 beats-per-minute or less. Let's create a simple function to determine how many times an athlete's heart may beat in 1 day at 40bpm.

var beatsPerDay = calcPerDay(40, 1440); // call the results of the function inside the variable beatsPerDay, using predefined parameters of 40, for 40 bpm, and 1440, for 1,440 minutes in one day.
